    Conversions between UTF32, UTF-16, and UTF-8. Source code file.
    Author: Mark E. Davis, 1994.
    Rev History: Rick McGowan, fixes & updates May 2001.
    Sept 2001: fixed const & error conditions per
        mods suggested by S. Parent & A. Lillich.
    June 2002: Tim Dodd added detection and handling of incomplete
        source sequences, enhanced error detection, added casts
        to eliminate compiler warnings.
    July 2003: slight mods to back out aggressive FFFE detection.
    Jan 2004: updated switches in from-UTF8 conversions.
    Oct 2004: updated to use UNI_MAX_LEGAL_UTF32 in UTF-32 conversions.

    See the header file "ConvertUTF.h" for complete documentation.

    Note A.
    The fall-through switches in UTF-8 reading code save a
    temp variable, some decrements & conditionals.  The switches
    are equivalent to the following loop:
        {
            int tmpBytesToRead = extraBytesToRead+1;
            do {
                ch += *source++;
                --tmpBytesToRead;
                if (tmpBytesToRead) ch <<= 6;
            } while (tmpBytesToRead > 0);
        }
    In UTF-8 writing code, the switches on "bytesToWrite" are
    similarly unrolled loops.
